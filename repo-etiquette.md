### A few rules to follow when using this repo.
- keep file paths short
- don't use strange characters or spaces in file names as this could cause problems converting between Mac and Windows systems
- always pull before starting to work on a project and before you push (most relevant if working with other people although that likely won't be the case in this repo)
